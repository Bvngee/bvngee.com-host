1. install docker engine on host machine
2. package containers locally with nix2container, build with skopeo (cross compile if 
        necessary & possible) to regular tar files, eg:
        `nix run .#containers.webhook.copyTo "docker-archive:webhook.tar:webhook:latest"`
3. send tar files to server (eg with `scp`), import to docker engine with `docker image load -i image.tar`
4. send over compose.yaml, which will spin up a registry, which will be exposed by nginx reverse proxy 
        image that was just manually imported and also started by compose.yaml
5. import all manually sent images to now-running registry, tar files can be deleted
6. from then on, use nix2container's skopeo to push directly to self-hosted registry and deploy from there
